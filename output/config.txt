# Warning: DO NOT DELETE FILE OR ITS CONTENT!
# This text file serves as a guide to the automation program. It keeps count of the number of automation processes done.
# A completed task is represented by a "|-"; I call it a "pipe-dash" character.
# For example: "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-" tells the automation program that a successful record has been done for seven iterations.
# After a successful automation iteration, the number of "pipe-dash" character gets incremented by 1.
# That is, for instance, it gets updated from "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-" to  "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-".
# The next line keeps count of the number of days the automation has kept track of.
# The last line in the file represent the date which the last operation was run.
